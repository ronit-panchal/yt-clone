        <p>ðŸš€ Aspiring Entrepreneur | Frontend Developer | Tech Enthusiast

I am currently pursuing a BA (Hons) from Delhi University while diving deep into Full-Stack Web Development. My journey doesnâ€™t stop hereâ€”next, I plan to specialize in Cybersecurity, combining my passion for technology with a vision to build a multinational company.

I am deeply interested in technology, AI, web development, personal development, and financial growth. Alongside tech, I have hands-on experience in marketing, trading, cryptocurrency, forex, and crypto mining, along with a strong understanding of computer and mobile applications.

What sets me apart? I am a lifelong learner, a keen listener, and a confident speakerâ€”always seeking new knowledge and skills that fuel my journey. My motivation comes from the pursuit of a successful business empire and the power to create global opportunities.

Letâ€™s connect and explore the future of tech, business, and innovation together!</p>
